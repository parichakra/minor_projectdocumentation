\section{Literature Review} 
The e-learning platforms has undergone a significant transformation in recent years, making it advances in technology and the increasing demand for flexible, accessible education. We explores key aspects of modern e-learning platforms and highlights the contributions of few similar platforms such as Udemy, Khan Academy, and Vedantu, as well as addressing unique challenges faced in regions like Nepal.

Personalization is a critical factor in the effectiveness of e-learning platforms. Research has shown that personalized learning pathways, recommendations, and adaptive content significantly improve learner engagement and outcomes \cite{brusilovsky2015open}.

Platforms like Khan Academy utilize data analytics to personalize the learning experience, providing students with customized recommendations based on their progress and performance.\cite{thompson2011khan}



In countries like Nepal, there is a significant gap in locally made regional learning content, which limits the effectiveness of e-learning platforms for local students. The lack of content in regional languages and culturally relevant materials can hinder learning. Addressing this issue involves developing and integrating local content that resonates with the students' cultural and educational contexts. Studies have shown that learning in one's native language significantly enhances comprehension and retention \cite{pradhan2011distance} .
